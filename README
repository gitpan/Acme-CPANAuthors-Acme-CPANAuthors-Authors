NAME
    Acme::CPANAuthors::Acme::CPANAuthors::Authors - We are CPAN authors who
    have authored Acme::CPANAuthors modules

Synopsis
        use Acme::CPANAuthors;

        my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new('Acme::CPANAuthors::Acme::CPANAuthors::Authors');

        $number   = $authors->count;
        @ids      = $authors->id;
        @distros  = $authors->distributions('ACALPINI');
        $url      = $authors->avatar_url('SHLOMIF');
        $kwalitee = $authors->kwalitee('SANKO');

Description
    This class provides a hash of Pause IDs/names of Acme::CPANAuthors::*
    authorin' CPAN authors.

    I started this module because Acme::CPANAuthors::UnitedStates doesn't
    exist and apparently I'm not listed in Acme::CPANAuthors::Japanese.
    ((sigh)) I just want to be a part of something... great... greater...
    than-- um, sorry, lost my train of thought.

    Anyway, I decided both Acme::CPANAuthors::Earth (well covered between
    http://search.cpan.org/author/ and
    http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=who_is) and
    Acme::CPANAuthors::Authors (only include authors who have published at
    least one distribution, script, etc.) would just be too time consuming
    for a 3AM lapse in judgement so... there you are.

Installation
    To install this module, run the following commands:

            perl Build.PL
            ./Build
            ./Build test
            ./Build install

Maintenance
    Have you authored a module in the "Acme::CPANAuthors" namespace, aren't
    listed here, and would like to be? Or are you currently listed but have
    since turned away from your deviant, "Acme" ways and would like to be
    removed? Just contact me via email or stop by the Issue Tracker and I'll
    fix ya right up.

Bugs
    Report any bugs or feature requests to the Issue tracker or directly to
    me via email. I'll keep you up to date on any related changes.

    Seriously, it's just a list of names... what could possibly go wrong?

    <_<

    >_>

    Yeah.
